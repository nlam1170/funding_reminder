# funding_reminder


quick script that pulls funding data from different large crypto exchanges for perpertual futures/swaps in both USD and USDT pairings. After careful observation, many exchanges seem to have a small spike in market price following the time afer funding settlements. Settlements can also offer good time periods to roll over positions.

After pulling this info, I decided to make use of Discord API so that I could easily receive reminders for funding times as discord messages. This way I can act on them easier
